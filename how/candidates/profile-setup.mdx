### Quick Tips

- Make your profile stand out.  Be specific with your skills.
- Ensure your CV is concise and accurate. Limit each role to 5-6 bullet points. Begin with outcomes: specify what was delivered, for whom, and the resulting impact. Include metrics—such as number of users, revenue or % improvement. Try and apply the STAR methodology - **Situation, Task, Action and Result**.
