    - Add in your new team members details including Full Name, email address and the role you want to give them.
    - User Role has full access to the site but cannot perform the following functions:

      - Upgrade/Change the Palantrix paid plans
      - Access to Billing Information - although an Admin can add specific non Admin users to receive Billing invoices if they so wish.
