    - Fill in the relevant details and add your job specification.
    - You can set an End Date if you only want the job to be Live for set period of time - or you can leave it open ended and close it manually yourself when you are ready.
    - Depending on your paid plan - Palantrix AI can assist you with writing that job spec.
    - After you have entered in the relevant details click on the Next button at the end of the page.
    - Palantrix AI will evaluate your requirements and create 8-10 questions based specifically on your job specification.
    - It will create these questions to evaluate the candidate with the following criteria in mind:

      | Analytical Thinking | Original Thinking    | Learning Agility |
      | ------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
      | Team Player         | Communication Skills | Accountability   |
      | Adaptability        | Drive                | Empathy          |
    - You have the ability to edit or remove any of these questions and even add your own ones.
    - You also have the ability to set specific time allocations to each question.

    <Note>
      We recommend keeping these interviews to a max of 20minutes to encourage positive engagement from candidates. This time allocation will provide plenty of insights and allow the AI to provide constructive feedback so you can make an informed decision about the next stage in your process.
