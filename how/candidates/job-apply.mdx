    - When you submit your interview to a job opening, whether it is a Palantrix Short or a Classic Job Post then you will receive the above submission page.
    - Your interview and AI evaluation has been sent to teh company for review by a human recruiter.
    - This page allows you to request feedback based on he evaluation submitted. This feedback will be provided after the human recruiter has made a decision on your application. It will be in the form of the Strengths and Areas of Improvement from the Interview, that was shared with the recruiter. We do this to promote tranparency across our platform.

    <Note>
      The AI evaluation does not make any recommendations to the recruiter. It provides a summary similar to the mock interviews. The human interviewer will then review the interview recordings along with the evaluation and THEY decide whether to take the candidate to the next stage in the evaluation process. A human recruiter will always interview the candidate before a hiring decision is made. Palantrix facilitates this virtual or in-person interview process on our platform as well.
