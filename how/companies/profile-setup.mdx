    The Profile 'boxes' appear on your Home page under the Explainer Video banner.

    - Click on each card within the Complete Your Profile section to add details about your Company:
      - Company Name.
      - Main Contact Person within your organisation linked to the Palantrix account.
      - Contact number.
      - Company Profile description - a sentence or two about your company.
      - Job Categories - just a general feel of what areas you are looking to source candidates in, so we can tailor your experience more appropriately.

    Adding these short details will help candidates know a bit more about your company when you go to post a Job or a Palantrix Short.
