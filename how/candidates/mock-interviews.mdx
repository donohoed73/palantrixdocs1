  **Just remember:**

  Our AI is a tool to help identify strengths and potential, not a judge of a person's worth. Human decision-makers consider many factors beyond what AI can measure. We believe in transparency, so we're happy to share insights that might help your professional growth—while recognising that you are far more than any score.
