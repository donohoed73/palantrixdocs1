- Use an email that is easily accessible to retrieve your OTP and complete your verification. This must be a business email account. Check that your business email filter has not blocked or put the OTP invite into the SPAM folder.
- If you have already created an account just use the Login option on the same page.
- If the prompt tells you that your password criteria has not been met, just check Step 4 above to ensure that the all 5 criteria are being met.
